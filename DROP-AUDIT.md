# Unique-drop audit — September 5, 2026

Rechecked all 62 included bosses against their RuneScape Wiki pages, following Araxxor to Araxxi, Vindicta to Vindicta & Gorvek, and Twin Furies to The Twin Furies for the actual reward tables. The Wiki collection-log calculator was used as a second item checklist; individual boss tables take precedence where the two disagree. This audits the existing catalogue, not every boss in RuneScape.

Nakatra's **Shard of Genesis Essence** was already present at **1/75 in hard mode**. It was hidden by the normal-mode dropdown. The target selector now lists the union of targets across a boss's scenarios, marks incompatible targets, and names compatible scenarios in the warning. Switching scenarios preserves the target; it never calculates normal-mode shard odds. [Nakatra source](https://runescape.wiki/w/Nakatra,_Devourer_Eternal#Drops).

## Added rates and conditions

- GWD generals: respective hilts (1/512), all three godsword shards (1/768 each), and lore books. Graardor and Zilyana books accompany the qualifying 1/64 equipment or 1/512 hilt event, giving 9/512; Kree'arra and K'ril list 1/64. See each boss link in the checklist below.
- King Black Dragon: Dragon Rider gloves/boots and both dragon kite ornament kits, each 1/2000.
- Solak: Cinderbane gloves and ancient elven ritual shard, each 1/1000.
- Corporeal Beast: holy elixir uses the exact table probability **3/512**, rather than the collection calculator's rounded 1/171.
- GWD2: essences are rolled after the equipment roll fails. Per-kill probability is `(1 - sum(equipment probabilities)) / essence denominator`, where the denominator is 64 normal or 44 hard. This uses the existing maximum-reputation presets; Vindicta has five equipment outcomes, the others six. This adjustment is derived from the Wiki's stated roll order, rather than treating a conditional 1/64 or 1/44 as an unconditional per-kill chance.
- Legiones: Ascension grips (1/2056, eligible Slayer assignment required), any Ascension Keystone (1/64), and any next Order journal page (1/19, until all are found).
- Rex Matriarchs: all four Skeka hypnowand pieces, requiring the Aged journal. All four boss pages list focus at 7/5000 and each other piece at 1/5000. Added the corresponding unchecked dinosaur on the three living matriarchs at 1/399. No luck or salamancy boost.
- Giant Mole: numbing root (46/520 normal, 10/520 hard) and hard-only ultra-growth potion (30/520), using members' tables.
- ROTS: unstable malevolent energy as a guaranteed stack, requiring successful escape. Black stone dragon: draconic energy as a guaranteed stack, under the existing pet-owned assumption.
- Ambassador: black stone heart stack at 1/2 solo/duo, 2/5 trio. Elite/ultra elite chests use 14/15 and 1/15 only when each planned kill completes an ordered ED1–ED2–ED3 trilogy. Crossbow-piece rolls remain separate aggregate targets.
- Manuscripts: Amascut at 1/10 from each Sanctum boss; Jas at 1/10 normal or 1/7 hard per personal Kerapac pile; Bik at 1/10 tertiary; Wen at 1/25 across three normal-mode rolls; Elidinis at 7/100 across four common-loot rolls.
- Arch-Glacor: normal mode has selectable mechanics and personal piles. At 0–1 mechanics, remnants are `20/200` with one pile and nilas are unavailable. At 2/3/4/5 mechanics, nilas chances per pile are `.09 * (.011/.020/.035/.035)`; remnants sum `.09 * (1 - nilas sub-roll chance)` and `.005 * (36/34/32/32) / 80`. Manuscripts use `1/25` per selected pile. Gladys uses `1/(18000 - 3000 * mechanics)` per pile and a 500-kill threshold. Scripture/artefact require five mechanics. Hard-mode remnants/manuscripts have no invented numerical preset. Normal tables and pet rules rechecked October 14, 2026; see SOURCES.md.
- Zuk: igneous stone is guaranteed only on a complete no-checkpoint run; unavailable in the hard-mode checkpoint preset. Normal mode displays the no-checkpoint prerequisite explicitly.
- Also added the Magister's Key to the Crossing, guaranteed/unowned Amascut and AoD books, Nex's Followers, and the three Dagannoth armour sets (1/64 per piece).

## Explicit limitations

Unknown-rate or unmodelled key targets are selectable with a **rate not modelled** status and explanatory text. These entries have no numerical denominator, graph, milestones, or inferred probability. They survive local-storage restoration. A mode restriction is distinct from an unmodelled rate: individual Kerapac/Zuk pieces are unavailable in normal mode and unmodelled in hard mode.

These entries include Saradomin's hum (Wiki says “Very rare”), Seeker's charm (“Rare”), the ambiguously applied seven-roll Hexhunter reward, Warpriest ownership rules, specific cycling weapon pieces/orbs/chests, non-pet lore mitigation, Hermod's drumsticks, the base araxyte pet and pheromone, Vorkath hide, and unknown manuscript rates. Existing **any next piece/orb/chest** targets remain usable. These do not predict a specific piece or completed weapon. [Warpriest drop template](https://runescape.wiki/w/Template:DropsLineWarpriest), [collection checklist](https://runescape.wiki/w/Module:Collection_log_calculator/Boss/Data).

This remains a key-equipment/component/pet calculator. Generic supplies, rare-drop-table items, clue scrolls, effigies, trophy heads/furniture plans, quest-only materials, crafted outputs and purchased pets are outside this audit's dropdown scope. Appearance and achievement unlocks, lucky-charm rewards, ordinary dungeon relics, and enrage/streak scenarios absent from the catalogue are not newly simulated. Eligibility prerequisites are shown as notes; the calculator does not query a player's account or inventory.

## Per-boss checklist

Every linked boss was checked. “Existing key targets retained” means no further fixed-rate key equipment/component target was identified within the scope above. The final column lists newly exposed targets that still need a dedicated probability model. Item names are deduplicated across modes in this checklist; actual rates remain scenario-specific.
